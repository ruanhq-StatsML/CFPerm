# CFPerm

Implementation for the "Leveraging Causal Inference for Detecting Distribution Shift": It provides implementation for leveraging causal inference methods to detect distribution shift via the varying types of the causal models including Causal Forests, DR-learner and Dragon-Net with permutation of the Variable Importance. The variable importance notions include PermuCATE(conditional permutation variable importance), LOCO(leave-one-covariate-out) and the Impurity Gain/Split Frequency Based Variable Importance for the Causal Forest.


### Motivation: Meta-Learner and Distribution Shift
We leverage the meta-learner(causal forest, doubly-robust pseudo-outcome learner and the R-learner) to quantify the distance between the two batches of datasets, then the variable importance for this version of meta-learner is a proxy for the distribution shift - from another aspect, so called OOD Variable Importance. The illustration of the feature selection as the validity of this proposed framework in both Covariate Shift(P(X) shift) and Concept Drift(P(Y|X) shift).

- For Covariate Shift(the feature selection consistency in terms of kendall's tau correlation is leveraged for efficiency of the ranking of the feature importance in the covariate shift).

- For Concept Drift(the feature selection consistency in terms of kendall's tau correlation is leveraged for efficiency of the ranking of the feature importance in the concept drift).

Then we adapt the second-stage feature selection followed by the distribution shift localization procedure - where the test itself is built upon whether significant features can be selected from the hypothesis testing procedure.


## Python version:

## Quick example

```r
library(CFPerm)
set.seed(1)
#Testing Case I, simulate with no distribution shift:
set.seed(2026)
n0 <- 200
n1 <- 200
n <- n0 + n1
p <- 10
X <- matrix(rnorm(n * p, 0, 1), nrow = n, ncol = p)
colnames(X) <- paste0("X", seq_len(p))
T <- c(rep(0, n0), rep(1, n1))
Y <- 1 + 0.8 * X[, 1] - 0.5 * X[, 2] + rnorm(n, sd = 1)
#The test result via the permuCATE variable importance
es_null_permucate <- cfperm(
  X = X,
  Y = Y,
  T = T,
  n_perm = 30,
  vimp = "permuCATE",
  seed = 2026,
  level_feature = 0.05,
  level_across_feature = 0.05,
  top_k = 1
)
#The test result via the LOCO variable importance
es_null_loco <- cfperm(
  X = X,
  Y = Y,
  T = T,
  n_perm = 30,
  vimp = "loco",
  seed = 2026,
  level_feature = 0.05,
  level_across_feature = 0.05,
  top_k = 1
)
#The test result via the GRF variable importance
es_null_grf <- cfperm(
  X = X,
  Y = Y,
  T = T,
  n_perm = 200,
  vimp = 'GRF',
  seed = 2020,
  level_feature = 0.005,
  level_across_feature = 0.005
)
#A reasonable amount of the permutation is required.
```
